Image Caption Generator
Project Overview
This repository contains the code for an Image Caption Generator that leverages deep learning techniques to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. The project integrates computer vision and natural language processing to build a model capable of understanding visual content and producing coherent textual descriptions.

Project Details
Objective: Develop a model that can automatically generate captions for images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating captions.
Dataset: The model is trained on a large dataset of images paired with corresponding captions.
Components:
Feature Extraction: CNNs are used to extract visual features from images.
Caption Generation: LSTM networks are employed to generate textual descriptions based on the extracted features.
Data Preparation: Includes image preprocessing and data augmentation to enhance model performance.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as BLEU score to ensure high-quality caption generation.
